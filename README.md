1. Pair programmed a command line based game with the option to play against another player locally or against the computer. The computer will "learn" as a series of player vs. cpu games progress by storing the choices it makes every round.
2. To play the game, run the stick_ai.py file in the terminal and enjoy.
3. This repo contains the tests file for the applicable functions of the game code (sticks_tests.py) and the game code itself, stick_ai.py
4. Made in collaboration with Nadia Mounzih
